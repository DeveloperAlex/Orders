    Hi,<br/>
    <br/>
    My name is Alex. &nbsp; This is my little sample MEAN Stack program to show to potential employers -
    plus for me to practice on. &nbsp; It has many of the features that a larger production app might include.
    &nbsp; Sorry, I'm not a UX designer - I know this could look prettier. &nbsp; I'm a hard core developer.<br/>
    <br/>

    It uses Node.js for the back-end RESTful service (using MongoDB as the data store). &nbsp; The front-end uses AngularJS
    (along w/ bootstrap & jquery).<br/>
    <br/>

    It is hosted in the Google Cloud. &nbsp; Running on an Ubuntu 14.04 Server. &nbsp;
    It uses nginx & pm2 to keep Node.js running smoothly.<br/>
    <br/>
